The game starts off with asking you to enter the number of rows and column.
then it will generate a grid based on the information entered.
Each grid contains one T(target) and some U(up), D(down), L(left), R(right). 
then the user is required to press on a grid is start the game. 
Once you press the grid,  it will automatically keep moving until the game is over or you win

If you reached the T meaning you won!

There could be 2 ways for the game to be over
1. You visited a grid that you visited previously
2. You went out of bound with the grids meaning you went outside the border

This game needs precise calculation. Good luck have fun
